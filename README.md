# Hopfield and MLP Neural Network
![snapshot](https://github.com/enggardwiprihastomo/Hopfield-and-MLP-Neural-Network/blob/master/snapshots.png)

These 2 projects were made in order to pass Neural Networks subject at Politechnika Warszawska.

# Hopfield Neural Network
The project was made dynamic, where user can create different patterns or load pre-existed pattern to the system. The results show that hopfield network can optimally converge the test pattern to one of the training patterns very well.

# Multi Layer Perceptron
The project was made dynamic, where user can build different network architectures. Graph also provided to let user know how the training goes. The results show that MLP can classify the data accurately. The accuracy score obtained after performing many different datasets is averagely 96%

# Result
I scored 40/40 points for these 2 projects
